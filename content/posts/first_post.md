# Introduction

Welcome to my first attempt at writing a page with _hugo_!\
I found a nice tutorial and I also wanted a personal web page / blog so... here we are.
If you actually found my website it either means two things:

- You saw my CV because I sent it to your company, were curious and found this mess of a site.\
  Congratulations, here's a virtual cookie for you.

- You know me personally... hello! \
  I was lying ... (who could have guessed?), there's also a third reason:
- Why not?

## What will I post here?

I absolutely have no idea, so let's just say that anything as long as it's not 18+ rated you know... there are other sites for that.\
I could post CTFs, showcases of things that I build (like I have time for them...),
basically anything goes!
