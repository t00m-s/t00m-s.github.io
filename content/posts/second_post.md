## Introduction

This is my personal report of what I did at the ISITDTU CTF with team bhackari, spoiler alert: not so much :(


Anyway, I initially wanted to practice pwn/rev (mainly rev) because I actually like reverse engineering and was thinking about finding a job as a red team operator.
As a premise, I literally slept three hours the night before so... things were going to be a bit spicy.
I arrived at the university late for personal reasons, but once I got there I discovered a harsh truth:

**rev was on windows binaries...**

so... there goes my chance of doing something?


UNLESS...

Let's go flag some forensics :D
