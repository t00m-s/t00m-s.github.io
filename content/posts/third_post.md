# Introduction
Hi!
Before starting this "project" of a personal blog, I honestly just wanted to use the github.io domain for
something...
But here we are!
Could I actually use this as a portfolio showcase? Might have to see if there is a cool minimal theme.
## Current life updates
Anyway, here's what I'm doing right now:
- Master's degree
- Learning about penetration testing, with HackTheBox and with CTFs
- Rewriting my dotfiles with Nix, this one is hard, but I love the idea.
- Studying for internships, who knows. Worst case scenario I refreshed some concepts from the DSA course.
- Looking for a job, quoting: "With a Bacherlor's degree in Computer Science you will surely find job instantly!"... yeah sure. This last phrase could honestly be a big skill issue check for me.

Anyway, spending atleast 15 to 30 min a day on topics that are in my interest seems like a decent way to start, for example I wrote this post in under 15 minutes and, except maybe some grammar horrors, it doesn't look too bad.


I miss my nvim config, right now i'm stuck with vanilla vim and kde, I want my tiling wm (hyprland) back... but I have to finish some uni projects and I can't afford to waste time.
